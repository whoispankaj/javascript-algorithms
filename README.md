Tips:

1. Arrays and Strings
   Decide whether to use for loop, while loop
   Check if the condition is correct for iteration of the array till the end
   Check if you need to recompute anything after the loop.
   If you are using a map to store keys and array index as values, consider the case of index 0 especially in if conditions
